## Brief Bio
As a dedicated AI researcher, my work bridges the gap between large language models and the complex, multi-modal world we live in. My journey began at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I completed my Ph.D. under the guidance of Professor Zenglin Xu. During my doctoral program, I also had the valuable opportunity to learn and grow as a research intern at Microsoft. This experience, combined with my subsequent role as a researcher at Tencent AI Lab, solidified my expertise in harnessing large-scale models for a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Recently, my focus has shifted to what I see as the next frontier: multi-modality and web agents. I am deeply fascinated by the pursuit of a unified paradigmâ€”a single, elegant model that can perceive, reason, and create across text, images, and other data formats. My long-term vision is to contribute to the development of a true "World Model." By integrating such a powerful generative and understanding system with autonomous agent technology, I aim to play a part in building the foundation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and creating systems that can truly benefit humanity.
